This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this challenge you build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, you learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
